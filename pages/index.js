      <h1>Therapies for Anxiety</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h2>Talk Therapy</h2>
          <p>
            Also known as psychotherapy, where stress is remedied by communication to identify and solve issues that cause emotional distress. This helps because it serves as an outlet for people that prefer to verbalize their stress.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>Art Therapy</h2>
          <p>
            Art therapy involves allowing kids to make art for their own relaxation and sometimes for therapists to interpret. This works because children who are unable to communicat etheir feelings and built-up stress can express it through art.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>Deep Pressure Therapy</h2>
          <p>
            Deep Pressure Therapy consists of applying gentle but firm pressure to the body with a pressure garment. This helps because it is similar to hugging and creating a comfortable environment where stress melts away.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
